## Description

Recent developments in quantum technology are bringing the world closer to a new technological revolution – the advent of usable quantum computers able to provide enormous acceleration to important computational tasks. In coming years, quantum computing is expected to have a huge impact on practically all areas of research that can utilise computational modelling.

The NordΙQuEst project brings together a consortium of seven partners from five Nordic and Baltic countries to connect world-leading traditional HPC resources and quantum computers across national borders with the aim to establish a quantum computing platform customised to the needs of the region.

ENCCS joined forces with NordIQuEst to deliver two-day training workshops covering the fundamentals of quantum computing (QC), including:
> - Introduction to key concepts: quantum states, qubits, quantum algorithms;
> - QC programming in high-level languages for use cases in optimisation, finance and quantum chemistry followed by testing quantum programs to esure their correctness;
> - Overview of the main QC hardware approaches;
> - Integration of QC with classical computing: hybrid classical/quantum algorithms and HPC-QC systems;
> - Introduction to quantum software testing with Quito tool;
